description: A summary of what to expect here.
---

Hi and welcome to my first blog post - If you're reading this you might be wondering what I plan on posting here, so I thought I'd write a small introduction to explain what to expect here.

  &nbsp;

I've decided to start a blog as a way to document things that I've learnt as well as things that I'm learning. I plan on documenting a range of things related web development from small tips and tricks I've picked up to how I've made things and concept's I've learnt.

  &nbsp;

These posts will mainly be for myself to refer back to things that I'm doing and have learnt but feel free to read through them if you find them interesting at all!
